        <p class="c-text">The primary mirror wings are now fully deployed and latched into place, but the individual
            mirror segments remain in their launch configuration. This operation is a multi-day, multi-step activity to
            activate and move each of the 18 primary mirror segments and the secondary mirror from their stowed launch
            configuration to a deployed position ready for alignment.
        </p>

        <p class="c-text">
            The 18 primary mirror segments and secondary mirror are adjustable via six actuators that are attached to
            the back of each mirror. The primary mirror segments also have an additional actuator at its center that
            adjusts its curvature. The telescope's tertiary mirror remains stationary. The primary and secondary mirror
            segments will move a total of 12.5mm, in small increments, over the course of ~10 days to complete each
            segment's deployment.
        </p>
        <p class="c-text">After all individual mirror segment deployments are completed, the detailed optical mirror
            alignment process begins which is about a 3 month process. In parallel, as temperatures cool enough,
            instrument teams will turn on their instruments and begin each instrument's commissioning process.</p>
